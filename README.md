*Son of Baby Tracker*

New, super simple Baby Tracker app. Again, this is meant to be used on mobile primarily (exclusively, really), so it's styled with that in mind. Just text entry with timestamps. No plots. No data. Just basic bizness here. 

Svelte + MongoDB Realm + DayJS, um I think that's it? 

Anon auth, so please do not abuse. May incorporate some NSFW filtering to keep the trolls out since it's public.
